# Hierarchical-Database-Management-System
This project leverages AVL trees to create a robust Hierarchical Database Management System tailored for organizations. The system efficiently manages employee data, structured by unique IDs, ensuring fast and reliable operations.

Developed an algorithm for managing hierarchical relationships and dynamic data updates.

Implemented an AVL Tree-based database, achieving O(log n) efficiency for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Optimized to handle range queries and sorted retrievals, offering a significant edge over hash-based methods for ordered data operations.

Ensured robust memory utilization and predictable performance with strict height balancing.

Tree construction achieves an efficient time complexity of O(n log n).

Designed to support scalable and adaptable hierarchical structures for organizational needs.

This solution is ideal for applications requiring reliable performance, ordered data retrieval, and efficient memory usage.
